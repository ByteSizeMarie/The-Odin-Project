# The-Odin-Project-coming-soon-

Hello and welcome to my The Odin Project repository!

I’m currently on my journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. As part of this, I’m working through The Odin Project curriculum to deepen my knowledge of both frontend and backend technologies.
This repository will document my progress as I work through the project’s lessons, exercises, and personal projects. Feel free to check back for updates as I continue my self-paced learning journey!
