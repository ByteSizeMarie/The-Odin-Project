    - can be typed directly at the end of the HTML file with the tag &lt;script&gt;

 - #### console.log() prints something to the developer console in the browser, this can help with finding mistakes
 - #### declaring variables 
    - ~~var~~ -  old way to declare variables,
    it has function scope (not block scope) and gets hoisted (used before declaring variable), which can cause unexpected behavior.

    - const - variables cannot change after assigning a value, constant
